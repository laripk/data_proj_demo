X	add user option for how to display NULLs
	FILL IN THE TESTS/REDO WITH TDD
	
	
	add min & max notes for the numeric fields
	maybe add checkbox helpers - un/select all
	
	create flexible add-filter
		hash of hashes
			first layer: fields
				second layer: "operators", but really metasearch field names
		then I need a way to generate the form display, 
			or do I just want to do the javascript hiding thing? 
				blech for ultimate version, but maybe good for current
			how about partials?
				metasearch fieldnames index into partials eval list
					ow
		list of filters to display choices
			way to remove already selected filters from display list	
			fields
				country
				region
				each of the numerics
			operators available for field
				country/region
					is one of list ("code in")
					description matches
					region in only
						if country already specified, apply that filter to choose list
				numerics
					lte, gte
					between A and B
					outside of A and B


	Create scheduling interface (lets user create a schedule for a query, 
	but since this is a demo won't actually run the schedules.) 


	Re-do imports with TDD & import remaining data (that will fit in db)

	Create permissions-based filtering system

	potential source of future imports: http://faostat.fao.org/
